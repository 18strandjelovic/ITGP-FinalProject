Due to unforseen version control issues, the built version of the game has had to be moved to "ITGP-FinalProject\Built Game"

we had found out that if the game was buit in a folder inside the project folder, it would inconsistently only work for the person who built it and only found out about the issue after 
turning in the project and report.

On a side note, if there is any problems viewing the project when it is pulled from either SVN or github, a reinport of all assests should resolve the issue.

We appologize for any inconvience
